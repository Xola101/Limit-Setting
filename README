This package performs the Higgs cross-section upper limit or
significance calculation using toys, running multiple jobs on a local
batch system or the Grid.

The actual calculation is performed with 

StandardHypoTestInv.C or
This does the p-value and limit calculations. 

StandardFrequentistDiscovery.C
This just combines the limits from the results of the p-values

These uses RooStats to calculate p-values
and perform a scan of signal strength compute the limits.

For batch/Grid running, the results for a few toys in each job are
writen to Results.root or p0.root files. These can then be loaded back
into StandardHypoTestInv/StandardFrequentistDiscovery to calculate the
final limits.

See the comments at the top of 

StandardHypoTestInv.C and
StandardFrequentistDiscovery.C 

for a summary of the options. A brief summary of the program options can be obtained by running

StandardHypoTestInv -h or 
StandardFrequentistDiscovery -h .
